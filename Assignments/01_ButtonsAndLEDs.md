# BUTTONS AND LEDs

For our first project, we'll limit ourselves to just buttons and LEDs. No fancy sensors, motors, or screens. This kind of limitation can drive creativity: the goal is to create something novel, interesting, fun, meaningful, and/or surprising from such simple means.

A few rules (though creative rule-breaking is encouraged):  
* No inputs/outputs other than buttons and LEDs  
* No `println()` commands to the Serial Monitor as part of the finished piece  
* You can use other types of buttons or LEDs if you want  

Over the course of the next few weeks you'll develop a simple breadboard prototype, refine it, and eventually make a polished version that we will document with video.

## PROJECT TIMELINE  

* **Jan 22:** Project assigned, create ideation drawings, read [Programming Primer](https://github.com/jeffThompson/PhysicalComputing/blob/master/Readings/ProgrammingPrimer_ProgrammingInteractivity_JoshuaNoble.pdf)    
* **Jan 29:** Feedback session, create refined sketches and breadboard prototype  
* **Feb 5:** Visit Fridman Gallery to see John Driscoll's show *Slight Perturbations*, continue working on project  
* **Feb 12:** Feedback session, finish project, **make sure the rest of your parts are here for next week!**  
* **Feb 19:** Monday schedule, no class!  
* **Feb 26:** Project due, critique
